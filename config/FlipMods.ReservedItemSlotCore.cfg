## Plugin GUID: FlipMods.ReservedItemSlotCore

[Client-side]

## This is disabled by default for a reason, and it is NOT recommended to enable this, especially in public lobbies. Enabling this while the host does not have the ReservedItemSlotCore mod CAN, and likely WILL cause de-sync issues.
## NOTE: If enabled, you will not receive any reserved item slots until the game has started.
## This setting only applies if you are a non-host client, and the host does not have this mod.
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: false
ForceEnableThisModIfNotEnabledOnHost = false

## For any reserved item slot mods that have a negative priority, by default, those slots will appear on the left side of the screen, rather than the right. Setting this option to false will have them appear on top of the slots on the right side.
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: true
DisplayNegativePrioritySlotsLeftSideOfScreen = true

## If true, all empty reserved item slots will be hidden from the HUD. This is a new config setting and might have bugs.
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: false
HideEmptyReservedItemSlots = false

## If true, the reserved hotbar slots will not fade with the rest of the default slots. Currently, the reserved hotbar slots will never fade while you're in the slots.
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: false
PreventReservedHotbarSlotFade = false

## This tooltip is shown next to the first reserved item slot.
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: false
HideFocusHotbarTooltip = false

## If true, held items in the reserved item slots that are not currently in the player's hand, will be shown holstered on the player. Example: The reserved flashlight will show up on the player's shoulder when not in their hands. This will do nothing for items that do not have a defined holstered location on the player.
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: true
ShowReservedItemsHolsteredOnPlayers = true

## If true, masked enemies will appear to have reserved items holstered when mimicking a player. The items shown will be the same items that the player, who the masked enemy is mimicking, has in their inventory. This will do nothing for items that do not have a defined holstered location on the player.
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: true
ShowReservedItemsHolsteredOnMaskedEnemies = true

## Disables/hides the energy bars from HotbarPlus from the reserved item slots (HUD).
## This will not do anything if HotbarPlus is not enabled.
# Setting type: Boolean
